### 1. What the Tool Is (and Isn't)

This Tool estimates where and when crashes have tended to happen, based on past patterns. It helps people study trends and compare "what-if" scenarios. It does **not** watch roads in real time, tell drivers what to do, or help during emergencies. The results are estimates, not guarantees, and should be interpreted with local knowledge and common sense.

### 2. Where the Data Came From and When It's Most Reliable

The models were built using Kansas data from **2012–2016**, checked on **2017**, and tested on **2018–2019**. They work best for **Kansas census tracts** during that time frame. Results outside Kansas or based on different data may not perform the same. Data from **2020 or later** (e.g., post-COVID) may reduce accuracy.

### 3. Who Should Use It and How

Designed for **transportation planners, engineers, researchers, and policy staff**, the Tool is meant for:
- Screening networks for patterns  
- Comparing areas or scenarios  
- Testing sensitivity to assumptions  
- Exploring policy ideas  

It is **not** for:
- Real-time decisions  
- In-vehicle or driver-facing apps  
- Risk scoring or routing  
- Any safety-critical application  

### 4. Important Limits to Keep in Mind

- Past patterns may not match current conditions.  
- Since 2019, changes in travel, enforcement, vehicles, and infrastructure may reduce accuracy.  
- Patterns learned from Kansas may not apply elsewhere.  
- Larger-area results may hide **local differences**.  
- All data includes **some error**.


### 6. What We Ask of Users

- Double-check findings with **recent, local info and expert review**  
- Revisit assumptions before applying results to **new places/times**  
- **Avoid safety-critical and real-time uses**  
- Follow all **laws, policies, and data agreements**  
- Do **not enter any personal data**  
- The Tool may not always be available — don't rely on it for uptime  
- Talk with professionals before taking action  


### 7. Warranties and Liability

The Tool and its outputs are provided **“as is”** and **“as available”**  
Kansas State University and contributors make **no promises or guarantees** about accuracy or fitness.  
They are **not liable** for any losses or damages related to Tool use.  
Do **not** use the Tool for safety-critical decisions.  
For real-time safety, rely on **official traffic and emergency systems**.
